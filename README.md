Jetpack Compose Navigation is a library that enables navigation between different screens (composables) within a Jetpack Compose application. It is the Compose-specific artifact of the broader Jetpack Navigation component, designed to provide a consistent and idiomatic way to handle navigation in a declarative Compose environment.
Key components of Jetpack Compose Navigation include:
NavController: This is the central API for the Navigation component, responsible for managing the navigation back stack and performing navigation actions.
NavHost: This composable links the NavController with a NavGraph and defines the composable destinations that can be navigated to. It acts as the container for your app's screens.
NavGraph: This collects all navigation-related data, including the different destinations (composables) and the possible paths between them. Destinations are typically defined using routes (strings or, more recently, type-safe serializable objects).
How it works:
Define Destinations: You define your app's screens as composables, each associated with a unique route.
Create a NavHost: You use the NavHost composable and provide it with a NavController and a startDestination (the initial screen).
Define the NavGraph: Inside the NavHost, you use composable blocks to define each screen and its corresponding route. You can also pass arguments between screens.
Navigate: When you want to move to a different screen, you use the NavController to call navigate() with the route of the target destination.
Benefits:
Declarative Navigation: Aligns with the declarative nature of Jetpack Compose, making navigation logic easier to understand and manage.
Back Stack Management: Automatically handles the navigation back stack, allowing users to navigate back through previously visited screens.
Argument Passing: Provides mechanisms to pass data between different composable destinations.
Deep Linking: Supports deep linking, allowing users to directly access specific screens within your app.
Type-Safe Navigation (with recent versions): Offers a more robust and less error-prone way to define routes and pass arguments using serializable objects.
